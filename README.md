## Create a sample pop! JS application using the terminal.<br>
Install the package with ```npm i -g create-pop-app```.<br>
Run ```create-pop-app <directory_name>``` and follow the instructions.<br>
## Motivation
Manually clone boilerplate for every new project is tedious and so this package was made for convenience and to imitate the project setup interface that other frontend frameworks have.<br>The script will clone the **demo-pop-app** repo and copy it to a user specified folder.<br>
The **demo-pop-app** repo is available at https://github.com/abiramrnair/demo-pop-app.<br>
