## Create a sample pop! JS application easily.<br>
1. ```npm i -g create-pop-app```<br>
2. ```create-pop-app <directory_name>```<br>
## Motivation
Manually cloning boilerplate for every new project is tedious and so this package was made for convenience and to imitate the project setup interface that other frontend frameworks have. The script will clone the **demo-pop-app** repo and copy it to a user specified folder. The **demo-pop-app** repo is available at https://github.com/abiramrnair/demo-pop-app.<br>
